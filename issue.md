# Remaining Work

## Frontend Components
The existing game UI components need to be rewritten for the ledger interface:
- **Games List** → **Records List**
- **Game Board** → **Transaction Viewer**
- Update game-specific UI elements to ledger-specific elements

## Git Remote
- Update to point to your StacksCoop repository

---

**Status**: The core infrastructure is now aligned with your Bitcoin-Anchored Community Transparency Ledger vision. The smart contract works correctly and can be deployed to testnet/mainnet when ready!
